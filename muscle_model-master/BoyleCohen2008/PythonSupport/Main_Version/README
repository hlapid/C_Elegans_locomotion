This is a port of the MatlabSupport code to Python, using NumPy and
Matplotlib. It could be more elegant, but to make things clearer and aid
debugging, I've used the same structure as the original Matlab code where
possible. Comments have also mostly been kept the same.

Key scripts:
 - compareToNeuroML2.py: Prints out a comparison of parameters between the BoyleCohen model and its NeuroML2 version
 - vclamp.py: Reproduces the voltage clamp simulation in the paper
 - iv_all.py: Plots I/V curves based on reproducing the equations directly

Some scripts are available in two versions: one using floating-point
arithmetic, the other using Python's arbitrary-precision Decimal library.
The floating-point scripts should give results compatible with those of the
original Matlab scripts, which also use floating-point. The Decimal versions
of the scripts run more slowly, but do not suffer from floating-point
round-off errors. The Decimal versions have filenames ending in "_decimal.py".
